## Firewatch Hot Syntax Theme

![overwatch-dark-syntax](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nektwar/overwatch-dark-syntax/master/screenshot.png)

A Syntax Theme forked from [SebastianSzturo](https://github.com/SebastianSzturo/firewatch-syntax) that was already inspired by [Firewatch](http://www.firewatchgame.com/).

I changed the colors to make it more attached to the palette Overwatch.

## Install

```
apm install firewatch-hot-syntax
```
